This folder contains some more "complete" test applications.

These test applications are not included in the standard regression test
because they are too big, that: 
1. It takes long to run them,
2. When something is wrong, it is difficult to pin-point the problem.

The idea is to put the compiled SIR source code for testing. The high-level
source code should be included (either in test or in benchmark directory),
but just for reference.
