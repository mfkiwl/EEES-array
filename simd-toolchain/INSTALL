This file contains instructions to build the toolchain for the Solver SIMD
processor framework

Dependencies
------------

The following are required to build the tool chain

 * CMake 2.6+ (http://www.cmake.org)
 * C++ compiler, preferably Clang 3.x
 * Lemon graph library 1.2.x (http://lemon.cs.elte.hu/)
 * Python 2 and its development files, 2.6+ (http://www.python.org)
 * LLVM (3.3, 3.4svn tested OK) (http://llvm.org)

Some dependencies are optional for additional features:
 * Sphinx: for generating documentation
 * Modelsim or Icarus Verilog: for RTL simulation
 * Solver-patched LLVM, to have a working C/C++/OpenCL compiler

Compiling
---------

It is recommended to use so-called out-of-tree build. First create a build
directory in the source folder (or any place you like) and go to there:
  
  mkdir build
  cd build

Then use cmake to configure the project:
  
  cmake ..

You can use standard cmake variables to control the configuration. For example,
the following command sets the C++ compiler to clang++ and the install prefix to
~/local (default is g++ and /usr/local, respectively):

  CC=clang CXX=clang++ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/local ..

To compile, run

  make

(Optional) To run the unit tests:

  make unittest

(Optional, recommended) To run the regression tests:

  make check

Installation
------------

If everything is OK, install the framework by running the following in the
build directory:

  make install

Clean-up
--------

To clean up, just remove the content of the build directory.
